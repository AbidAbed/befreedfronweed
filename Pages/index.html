        <p class="f3">Drugs are substances that change a person’s mental or physical state, they can affect the way the brain works, how a person feels and behaves, their understanding and senses. This makes drugs unpredictable and dangerous, especially for young people, and as the gateway Foundation, an expert on treating addiction towards drugs, has said "<em>Substance use disorders are associated with a wide range of short- and long-term health effects. They can vary depending on the type of drug, how much and how often it’s taken and the person’s general health. Overall, the effects of drug abuse and dependence can be far-reaching. They can impact almost every organ in the human body.</em>"</p>
